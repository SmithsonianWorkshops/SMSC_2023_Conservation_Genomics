# SMSC 2023 Conservation Genomics

We will add important links to this page throughout the course. Readings will be on Dropbox and questions can be asked during class or in Slack.

Workshop data are in ```/data/genomics/workshops/smsc_2023/```

We will be using a few data sources to learn how to use many different software packages for conservation genomics:
  - Clouded leopard genome assemblies and annotations published in Bursell et al., 2022. One for _Neofelis nebulosa_ and one for _Neofelis diardi_.
  - PacBio, Hi-C data, and Illumina from a new clouded leopard (_Neofelis nebulosa_.
  - Illumina short-read data from 4 additional clouded leopards (all _Neofelis nebulosa_).
  - RNAseq data from multiple tissues of a Red Siskin (_Spinus cucullata_.
  - Illumina data from 10 Red Siskins from two populations, mapped to a hybrid PacBio/Illumina assembly.
